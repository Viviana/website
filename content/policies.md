### How to be Successful in the Course?

Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. Programming is a skill that is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class.

In general, any submitted work written work (quizzes and final project) is assessed on these evaluative criteria: 

*	**Thoroughness** – each question is addressed and well-explained 

*	**Rigorous analysis** – analytically rigorous in tackling the assignment 

*	**Professional presentation** – explain codes with notes, accurate interpretation of results 

*	**Problem-solving acumen** – show accumulated learning to approach statistical problems

**Calculation of Grades** 

Student performance in the course will be graded based on the following scale: 

 Grade | Performance 
:----:| :-------:
    A  |  92-100% 
    A- |  90-91%  
    B+ |  88-89% 	
    B  |  82-87% 
    B- |  80-81% 
    C+ |  78-79% 
    C  |  70-77% 
    F  |  69% or below 

### Assignments and Gradings  

Your grade for this course will be determined by the following:   

*	Assignments 20%
*	Quizzes 40%
*	Final project 40% 


#### Assignments  
There will be six assignments in this course, each due on Wednesday before the next Thursday lab session. You are encouraged to help each other figure out the answers to the problem sets, but it is expected that you write up your answers independently.  

Once the assignments are submitted on GradeScope, students will be given a detailed answer key to grade their assignments and make corrections and notes to explain each error made by the following Tuesday. The TA and I will re-check all self-graded assignments afterward. No matter the score it actually receives, each self-graded assignment will get a full score for the assignment. An assignment not self-graded then will get zero points. In other words, careful work with self-reflection will be counted.   

The whole point of self-grading is to foster reflective and intentional learning—to give you a safe space to reflect on your learning and identify mistakes shortly after making them and revise as needed. The process empowers students to learn effectively and take the initiative in their learning.  

#### Quizzes  
Additionally, there will be two take-home quizzes – covering the first-half and second halves of the course, respectively. You are expected to work on take-home quizzes without the assistance of any other person. You may, however, consult any textbook or internet-resources.  

Students will receive a detailed answer key to self-grade the quizzes, and the instructor will re-check and adjust the grades if needed. While the quizzes will not be adjusted for self-reflection and correction, they have extra credit questions for students to get bonus points.  

### Policy Research Report (Team project)  
The final project is designed so that each of you will bring a problem of personal interest to the class. You will need to identify a problem to tackle with a data set that either you collect/extract or find. This project team involves a group of up to 3 members. A complete write up is required. This would be a good project to put in your CV if desired.  

*	A well-motivated, relevant topic is most desirable.
*	Originality, complexity, and challenge will be another plus.
*	A complete, professional write up is a must.
*	Maximum of 15 double-spaced pages, in APA 7th format. 
*	IPUMS, Google Dataset, Kaggle are some good places to find a data set.  

__A monthly team check-in with the professor is highly recommended to meet the monthly goal.__  
The final project will be accompanied by a rubric describing the allocation of points and criteria for evaluation. Each group will have a chance to review and provide feedback on the presentation and report from another group. The instructor will grade the final project. The final grade of the course will be adjusted for peer evaluation from your teammates. 
Late Work Policy
It is imperative that you manage your workload properly for this course. We will allow late
assignments up to 3 days late, with a 15% penalty per day. Note that lateness will be determined by timestamp on Gradescope submissions, i.e. 05:01 PM is considered late. A negotiated change of due date may be possible if you notify me at least 48 hours in advance of the deadline.  In the event of last-minute emergencies (loss in family, hospitalizations), please let me know as soon as possible. I expect that you will make every effort to promptly complete work for assignments and to communicate consistently with group members.

### Academic Honesty  
The integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research. Academic honesty is therefore required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University. Sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. You can learn more about Academic Honesty here, and about how to avoid plagiarism here. 
No Social Loafing/Free Riding
Social loafing or free riding occurs when a group member relies on the remaining group members to complete group tasks and does not contribute to group work. To discourage free riding, individual group member's contribution to the group project will be assessed by confidential peer evaluations at the end of the semester. If the peer evaluations you receive clearly show that you are a free rider, your individual grade on the group project will be adjusted.

### Disability Access
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities and help create a barrier-free campus. If you have a documented disability on file with Disability Services, you may be eligible for reasonable accommodations in this course. If your disability requires an accommodation, please notify me as early as possible in the course so that we may make arrangements in a timely manner.
